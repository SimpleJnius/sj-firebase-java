## Troubleshooting

For help with issues which you might encounter when using this template, please refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Gradle Setup üêò

This template is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the Gradle Version Catalog in the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) file in the `gradle` folder.

## Static Analysis üîç

This template is using [**detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task). It also uses the **detekt-formatting** plugin which includes the ktlint rules (see https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/formatting/).

## CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template, just make sure that you turn on the "Read and Write permissions" on the Action Settings of your repository.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Validate Gradle Wrapper](.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- [Pre Merge Checks](.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) - Will run the `build`, `check` and `publishToMavenLocal` tasks.
- [Publish Snapshot](.github/workflows/publish-snapshot.yaml) - Will publish a `-SNAPSHOT` of the libraries to Sonatype.
- [Publish Release](.github/workflows/publish-release.yaml) - Will publish a new release version of the libraries to Maven Central on tag pushes.

## Publishing üöÄ

The template is setup to be **ready to publish** a library/artifact on a Maven Repository.

For every module you want to publish you simply have to add the `publish` plugin:

```
plugins {
    publish
}
```

### To Maven Central

In order to use this template to publish on Maven Central, you need to configure some secrets on your repository:

| Secret name | Value |
| --- | --- | 
| `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_NEXUS_USERNAME` | The username you use to access Sonatype's services (such as [Nexus](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and [Jira](https://issues.sonatype.org/)) |
| `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_NEXUS_PASSWORD` | The password you use to access Sonatype's services (such as [Nexus](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and [Jira](https://issues.sonatype.org/)) |
| `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_SIGNING_KEY` | The GPG Private key to sign your artifacts. You can obtain it with `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <your@email.here>` or you can create one key online on [pgpkeygen.com](https://pgpkeygen.com). The key starts with a `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`. |
| `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_SIGNING_PWD` | The passphrase to unlock your private key (you picked it when creating the key). |

The template already attaches `-sources.jar` to your publications via the new AGP publishing DSL.

Once set up, the following workflows will take care of publishing:

- [Publish Snapshot](.github/workflows/publish-snapshot.yaml) - To publish `-SNAPSHOT` versions to Sonatype. The workflow is setup to run either manually (with `workflow_dispatch`) or on every merge.
- [Publish Release](.github/workflows/publish-release.yaml) - Will publish a new release version of the libraries to Maven Central on tag pushes. You can trigger the workflow also manually if needed.

### To Jitpack

If you're using [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/), you don't need any further configuration and you can just configure the repo on JitPack.

You probably want to disable the [Publish Snapshot] and [Publish Release](.github/workflows/publish-release.yaml) workflows (delete the files), as Jitpack will take care of that for you.

## Project Structure

The project includes three sub-projects, each in their own subdirectories:

- **`app`:** The source for the final Android application.
- **`library-android`:** The source for an Android library including UI.
- **`library-kotlin`:** The source for a UI-less Kotlin library.
- **`library-compose`:** The source for a UI library with Jetpack Compose library.

The following additional top-level directories configure & support building the app & projects:

- **`buildSrc`:** Contains shared Gradle logic as [precompiled script plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:precompiled_plugins)
- **`config`:** Contains the [Detekt configuration file](https://detekt.dev/docs/introduction/configurations/).
- **`gradle`:** Contains Gradle Configuration files such as the Gradle Version Catalog and the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

Finally, the following hidden top-level directories provide functionality for specific development systems:

- **`.github`:** Defines the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI tasks and templates for new pull requests, issues, etc.
- **`.idea`:** Sets common initial project settings when the project is opened in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
